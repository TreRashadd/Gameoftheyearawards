# **This project is one of my own creation for my Google Data Analytics Certification Course.**



In this project I am tasked to find, and sort data from external websites to find the top 50 games that came out in the year of 2022. I am to find out which game has sold the most copies, received the best ratings based on the customer reviews, which systems the games are compatible with and when the games released and create a dashboard in Excel and present it to my team to review my analysis.
